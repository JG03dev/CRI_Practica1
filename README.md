# Crossword Puzzle Solver
This repository contains a project that solves crossword puzzles given a dictionary of words. The solution is found using backtracking with forward checking. The project also includes tests with different sizes of dictionaries and crosswords.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to solve crossword puzzles. Given a crossword grid and a dictionary of words, the program fills the grid with words from the dictionary that fit the given constraints.

## Backtracking with Forward Checking
The solution is found using a backtracking algorithm with forward checking. Backtracking is a general algorithm for finding all (or some) solutions to computational problems, particularly constraint satisfaction problems. Forward checking is a way of improving the efficiency of the backtracking algorithm by checking constraints as the algorithm progresses.

## Testing with Different Sizes
This project includes tests with different sizes of dictionaries and crosswords. This allows us to evaluate the performance and efficiency of the algorithm under different conditions.

## How to Use
Clone this repository.
Run the Python script on your crossword puzzle and dictionary.

Please note that this project is still finished. Even though, contributions and suggestions are welcome!
